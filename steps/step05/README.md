linearityFlatPairs has 330 pairs logarithmically spaced from 100 e/pixel to 250k e/pixel
in the red LED.  The order of the fluxes is randomized (grouped by filter).  Only the
ND_OD0.5 and empty filter settings are used.  At the transition flux, four flux points are
measured in both ND_OD0.5 and empty filters, so the effects of spectral differences can be scaled out.
With this overlap, this configuration file actually acquires 334 pairs.

Syntax for CCOB WB flats is not yet define.

Note:  An [ANALYSIS_RUNS] entry for gains should be specified in the file
